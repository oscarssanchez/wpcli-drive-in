A boilerplate for simple WP CLI Commands to grab and go!

I found myself writing one time use WP CLI commands more than often and I hated repeating the same basics 
over and over again.

This is just a pretty simple and straightforward boilerplate that enables you to start writing 
your commands without the torture of starting from scratch something that you have done more than
 a couple of times.

##Usage
 
Search and replace the following strings:

* grabandgonamespace - Name of your namespace
* grabandgocommand - Name of the actual command to call
* grabandgoauthor - Author name
* Grab And Go Command - The name displayed in the plugin dashboard

And don't forget to fill in the plugin details! There you go!
